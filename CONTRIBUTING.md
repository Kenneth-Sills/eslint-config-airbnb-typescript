# Contributing

## Commit Messages

Please use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) with the [conventional changelog types](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum). These allow us to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) in our [automated release pipeline](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release).

You may be asked to rebase your branch if the commit messages need to be fixed (and cannot be addressed with a simple squash merge).

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. A pull request should, ideally, focus on a single improvement or fix. If you have many changes or improvements, consider breaking your work apart and submitting as multiple PRs.
2. If your branch has many commits, please consider rebasing _before_ submitting the pull request. Once a pull request has been made and a reviewer assigned, please _do not_ rebase or rewrite your branch history unless asked.
   - Your changes may be squashed on merge to keep the changelog clean.
3. Please give maintainers / reviewers up to 2 weeks to reply. After that, feel free to bump!

## Third-Party Types

Because the upstream [Airbnb eslint config project](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base) provides no type declarations, we've needed to add our own for Typescript to pass validation. These can be found under `types/third-party/eslint-config-airbnb-base/`.

Because the upstream project is rarely updated and this is a temporary solution, these were manually generated by having `tsc` generate declarations from the [rules files](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb-base/rules/) with one modification to add a trailing [`as const`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-5.html#const-assertions-and-default-type-arguments-in-jsdoc) on the exported object literals. If we need to update these in the future, it's likely we should actually contribute to the upstream or make a submission to the [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped).
